# Contributing to TANTALUM
TANTALUM is an amazing project, at least in our eyes. And it would be even better if you help us! Even if you don't have any experience coding! For example with these things:
* Report a bug (or even typo's)
* Submit a feature request

If you have a bit more experience coding you might be able to do the following:
* Submit a fix
* Work on new features

# How can you contribute?
For bug reports / feature requests, head over to the Issues page and make a new issue. We've set you up with some templates.

## Making issues
We love seeing bug reports and feature request, because that way we can make the code better! For making good issues, you can follow these tips:
* Follow the template
* Fill in everything (that you can fill in)
* You can better say something twice instead of not saying it

## Contributing to the code
You can do that by forking the repository, making the changes and making a pull request. For that, there's a template.

### Keeping the code clean
We, of course, want to keep our code tidy. So we ask you, when contributing, to write clean code. You can achieve this with the following:
* Make comments in the code for what that section does
* Make use of tabs to keep the code a bit more readable
* Make camel case (preferably in the form of camelCase and not CamelCase)
* Try to make the variables kind off logical, not naming them X or Y

# Licensing and crediting
When you make a merge request, there'll be a chance that it'll be merged. When it's merged it's part of the code, so it's under the GPL-3.0 Software License. This also means that *your* part of the code is under that license.
